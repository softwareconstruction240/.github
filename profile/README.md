## Welcome

Advanced Software Construction provides you with the experience and skills necessary to use a modern programming language in an advanced development environment to design, test, and build a large multi-user application. Your application will have a client frontend program that communicates, over the network, with a centralized backend server.

The content for this course is represented by the following parts.
